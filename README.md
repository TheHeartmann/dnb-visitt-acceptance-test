# DNB Visitt

NOTE: this is the version of the solution that was presented at the acceptance test. With the exception of this little explanatory paragraph and [this section relating to the availability of the deployed website](https://github.com/TheHeartmann/dnb-visitt-acceptance-test#heroku-build), everything is exactly as it was. Creating this 'frozen fork' of the original repository allows the team members to keep building on the solution without fear of breaking any rules related to evalutaion of the project. The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/TheHeartmann/dnb-visitt), should you be interested in seeing it.

Repo for redoing the DNB Visitt application with Node.js, React, Firebase, Heroku, and Travis. Whew.

## Getting started

### Install modules in root folder and in react-ui
Running `npm install` in both folders will sort this. Or, if you're on a Unix-based system, and have `concurrently` installed `npm run install-all` (or `yarn add-all` for yarn users) will install all the necessary dependencies in both folders.

### root: `node server`
This will start the server on port 5000. This is only useful for activating email services, however, and with the restrictions of the free Mailgun account, emails will only be sent to one of a set of six predefined addresses. However, not running the server, might lead to some unexpected behavior on mail sending attempts.

### /react-ui: `npm start`
This will run the dev server from localhost:3000. Hot reloading is enabled so anytime anything is saved, the app reloads reflecting changes. Note: this only loads the frontend of the site, although it is nearly fully functional on its own.

### If you have concurrently installed: `npm run dev`
This will start both the server and the frontend, assuming you're in the root folder.

## The tools

### React

Facebook's own front-end JavaScript library. Totally cool.

#### Redux

Appears to be the most recommended way of dealing with state in React. Oh, and I love it.

### Google Firebase

Free, quick, no-server, NoSQL database. Denormalize!

### Heroku

Deployment service, so that the page can always be found somewhere. Note: not publicly available.

### Travis CI

Continous integration service that will run tests, make sure the build succeeds on a server (hint: a lot of them run Linux!), and can, optionally, deploy to a hosting service of your choice. They're good guys.

### 'But wait, what about Node?'

Good point! While there didn't seem to be a need for it originally, an Express server was created to support sending emails on booking and inquiries.

## Project structure

Root folder is separated into `server` and `react-ui`. The former naturally has configuration relating to the node server, while the latter contians the frontend of the website.

### Structure: `react-ui`

All files to be deployed must go in `src`. Other files, e.g. for documentation, can go anywhere else in the directory.

Generally the project is structured into a few main folders:
`components`: contains the presentational components
  All subfolders are organised by main page, and then any subcomponents they use. Try and keep components and other dependencies as local as possible.
`redux`: contains the state and logic of the application
`firebase`: Contains files relating to the database
`mailHandler`: Contains mail handling functions.
`routing`: Contains the website paths and routing setup
`helperFunctions`: contains a number of useful functions used throughout the project.

## JavaScript Standard Style: style guide
This project uses JavaScript Standard Style.
Some basic usage is outlined below. For more info, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard

### `$ standard`
Presents a list of issues in your code, or nothing if none are found

### `$ standard --fix`
This will try and fix as many errors as it can, but there are certain things it cannot handle.
These must be fixed manually.


## Git guide: git gud or git rekt

### Don't be afraid of branches
Use them. A lot. It's much better to have many, short-lived branches, than few long ones. Make them small enough that you can go through a few a day, even.

Oh, and remember to delete them (both upstream and locally) when they're not useful anymore!

#### Branch naming
Accepted naming conventions

`feature/my_new_feature` — new features

`bugfix/breaking_bug` — bugfixes

`style/new_styling` — pure styling

`refactor/thing_to_refactor` — refactoring

`x/my_exciting_test_feature` — for experimental stuff that might never make it in to the actual project

### Commits

Commit early, commit often. Push when you have something implemented, so that it won't break anyone's experience should they jump on your branch.

### Merge tactics

Go ahead and grab the alias `mergetest` from the .gitconfig example. This is a very handy tool, which'll tell you whether you'll get any conflicts or not.

Stay up to date with master and merge it into your branch whenever it updates (`git merge master`). This decreases the chance of conflicts

Also, before merging back into master, it's not a bad idea to merge master into your branch first, thereby avoiding conflict resolving on master.

#### .gitconfig

See the git resources folder for an example of a .gitconfig file whith a lot of useful aliases etc.

##### Aliases

Want to create custom commands? Want git gud or git rekt to acutally do something useful? Well, you can! Just configure them in your .gitconfig file!

#### Windows: Chocolatey, ConEmu and posh-git

This is a set-up I've been recommended by a very tech-savvy and terminal-happy coworker of mine.


#### macOS: iTerm2 and Oh My Zsh

This is my setup (using theme powerlevel9k), and it rocks my socks.

## Heroku build

The Heroku build is available at [this url](http://dnb-visitt.herokuapp.com/).
It is currently "offline for maintenance" while we're working on password protecting it.
